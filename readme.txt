== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Nothing appears...what´s the issue? =
Please check your included facebook page URL. It´s important to put the complete URL like: https://www.facebook.com/danielederosaweb

Well, Facebook itself has a size limit for the enduser. You can see the limits directly in the options panel as helper (Section: Dimensions)

= Your plugin requires another plugin? Why? What it is? =
The required plugin (Redux FW) is a framework to manage options more efficient. You will like this backend! Why i don´t embedded it in my plugin easly? Well.. Wordpress itself does not allow this.
